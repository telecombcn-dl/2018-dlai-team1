To run our experiments we used Google Cloud's Compute Engine. Each experiment was run in an individual instance with 4 CPU threads and 1 GPU.
<br />
We reproduced the results for the 4 datasets used in the paper: MNIST, FashionMNIST, Cifar10 and CelbA. In order to do that, the same SN-DCGAN architecture as in the paper was used.
<br />
For each dataset we run an experiment without PA as a baseline and also with PA to see if it improves. The results of those comparisons can be shown in the figures below.

As you can see, for the first two datasets we have achieved the results from the paper. However, we show below that we could not reproduce the results for the two others yet. We are still running the experiments and we expect to have them all ready for the reproducibility challenge deadline. However, we have run into some difficulties when trying to find the right hyperparameters. We think that this is the reason why we have not been able to achieve the same results yet for the Cifar10 and the CelebA datasets, which are obviously more complex and thus, more "hyperparameter dependant". Some of the hyperparameter specifications that leads to confusions are:
</p>

<ul style='text-align: left;'>
  <li>For the Cifar10 dataset, it is not clear whether they use a learning rate = 4e-4 or lr= 2e-4.</li>
  <li>It is clear on the paper that when achieving a new augmentation level the Generator’s learning rate must be decreased and, however, they do not state in the experiments section how they implemented it.</li>
  <li>We think there is an error in when they explain Progression scheduling. When they state the following sentence:
  <br>
  <blockquote>“If the current KID score is less than 5% of the average of the two previous ones attained at the same augmentation level, the augmentation is leveled up, i.e. L is increased by one”</blockquote>
  we think they mean that the <strong>difference</strong> between the current KID and the mean of the last two, is the one which should be less than the 5% of the average of the two previous ones attained at the same augmentation level.</li>
</ul>

We plan to contact with the authors of the paper in order to clarify them.
