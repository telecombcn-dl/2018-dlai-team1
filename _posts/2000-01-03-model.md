In this work it has been proposed a novel method - progressive augmentation (PA) - to improve the stability of GAN training, and showed a way to integrate it into existing GAN architectures with minimal changes. Different to standard data augmentation our approach does not modify the training samples, instead it progressively increases the dimension of the discriminator input space by augmenting it with auxiliary random variables. Higher sample space dimensionality helps to entangle the discriminator and thus to avoid its early performance saturation. The training can  be shown below:

SN-DCGAN is the architecture that has been adopted as a baseline for this paper and the corresponding scheme can be shown in the first figure, where the discriminator and the generator are matched respectively with a) and b) of the second figure attached below:
